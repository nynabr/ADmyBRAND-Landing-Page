## Challenges and Solutions

### AI Limitations Encountered
1. **Context Switching**: AI sometimes lost context between related components
   - **Solution**: Used clear, detailed prompts with full context
2. **Complex State Management**: AI struggled with cross-component state
   - **Solution**: Manual implementation of global state logic
3. **Performance Optimization**: AI didn't always consider bundle size
   - **Solution**: Manual code review and optimization

### Best Practices Developed
1. **Iterative Prompting**: Start with basic structure, then add complexity
2. **Component Isolation**: Generate components independently for better results
3. **Manual Integration**: Use AI for components, manual work for connections
4. **Quality Review**: Always review and test AI-generated code thoroughly

## Conclusion

AI-assisted development significantly accelerated the creation of this modern SaaS landing page. The combination of multiple AI tools allowed for rapid prototyping, consistent code quality, and implementation of advanced features that would have taken much longer to develop manually. The key to success was understanding each AI tool's strengths and using them strategically while maintaining human oversight for critical business logic and integration work.

The project demonstrates how AI can be effectively used to create production-ready applications while maintaining high code quality and modern development standards.
